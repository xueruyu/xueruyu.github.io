Teaching at New Mission High School
======
In 2023, I implemented a two-week Data Science curriculum developed by MIT. My ninth-grade students engaged in an identity activity called the Daisy Model, where they reflected on critical aspects that defined them and shared with each other. They learned how to categorize, clean, format, and visualize data by combing information from their Daisy Models into a group dataset in Google Sheets. I also led students to participate in the Day of AI event. They debated about policies regarding social media. See the news report here.
