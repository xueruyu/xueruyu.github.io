## CS

I worked as a teacher at New Mission High School, a Title I school located in Boston, MA. Part of my responsibilities is teaching four sections of 9th grade students block-based programming language using Trinket and Thunkable. I adapted a project-based curriculum to accommodate student needs and interests, including transforming e-textbooks into student workbooks.  

In May 2023, I implemented a two-week Data Science curriculum developed by MIT. My 9th grade students engaged in an identity activity called the Daisy Model, where they reflected on critical aspects that defined them and shared with each other. They learned how to categorize, clean, format, and visualize data by combing information from their Daisy Models into a group dataset in Google Sheets. I also led students to participate in the Day of AI event. They debated about policies regarding social media. See the news report here.
