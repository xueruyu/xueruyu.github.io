<p> I taught a breadth of CS topics (e.g, block-based programming language and Java) and math topics (e.g, algebra, function, and trignometry) in high schools. I value learner-centered classes that encourages exploration and expression. </p>  

<p> I adapted a project-based curriculum amd taught 9th grade students block-based programming language using [Trinket](https://trinket.io) and [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com). Students were introduced to concepts such as variables and abstractions as they develop, test, and refine their programs. Example projects included creating computer programs to generate sci-fi names for users, designing apps that allow users to free draw, and building super Mario games.</p>
