<p> I taught a breadth of CS topics (e.g, block-based programming language and Java) and math topics (e.g, algebra, function, and trignometry) in high schools. I value learner-centered classes that encourages exploration and expression. </p>  

<p>During my role as a high school CS teacher, I adapted a project-based curriculum amd taught 9th grade students block-based programming language using [Trinket](https://trinket.io) and [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com). Students created computer programs to generate sci-fi names for users, designed apps that allowed users to free draw, and built their super Mario games.</p>
