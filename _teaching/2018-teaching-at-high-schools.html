<p> I taught a breadth of CS topics (e.g, block-based programming language and Java) and math topics (e.g, algebra, function, and trignometry) in public high schools since 2018. I strive to create learner-centered experiences that encourages exploration and expression. </p>  

<h2>Example CS project: Sci-Fi Name </h2>
<p> This project uses <a href="https://trinket.io">Trinket</a> and is part of an introductory project-based CS curriculum for grade 9 students. It asks students to generate a personalized sci-fi name for users and engages students with string, variable, concatenation and agile software development process. I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZqqAe3hpnCs95VoLtKUg00F46eqVU-T-_oQrN3o7rKM/edit?usp=sharing">adapted the project</a> by simplifying e-textbook instructions, adding visuals for scaffolding and transforming into Google Slide workbooks. Below is a sample student work.</p>

<h2>Example AI project: Daisy Model </h2>
<p>This project is part of a two-week Data Science curriculum developed by MIT for grade 9 students. Students reflected on critical aspects that defined them and shared with each other. They learned how to categorize, clean, format, and visualize data by combining identity information into a group dataset in Google Sheets. I adapted the project by providing concrete examples for some steps. </p>    
<h2>Example Math teaching materials: Fraction </h2>
In Spring 2021, I was a student teacher at Glencliff High School, a Title I school located in Nashville, TN. I was mentored by Ms. Diaz and Ms. to teach math to 9th grade students with interrupted formal education. I assisted with creating lesson materials that meet content, language, and socio-emotional objectives. Below shows a
