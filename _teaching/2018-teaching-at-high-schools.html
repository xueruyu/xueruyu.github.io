<p>This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.</p>  

<h1>CS</h1>
<p>I worked as a teacher at New Mission High School, a Title I school located in Boston, MA. Part of my responsibilities is teaching four sections of 9th grade students block-based programming language using Trinket and Thunkable. I adapted a project-based curriculum by transforming e-textbooks into student workbooks and creating scaffolding materials. Below shows a sample student Trinket program that generates sci-fi names for users.</p>

<p>In May 2023, I implemented a two-week Data Science curriculum developed by MIT. My 9th grade students engaged in an identity activity called the Daisy Model, where they reflected on critical aspects that defined them and shared with each other. They learned how to categorize, clean, format, and visualize data by combing information from their Daisy Models into a group dataset in Google Sheets. I also led students to participate in the Day of AI event. They debated about policies regarding social media. See the news report here.</p>
