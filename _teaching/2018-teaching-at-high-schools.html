<p> I taught a breadth of CS topics (e.g, block-based programming language and Java) and math topics (e.g, algebra, function, and trignometry) in high schools. I value learner-centered classes that encourages exploration and expression. </p>  

<p> I adapted a project-based curriculum amd taught 9th grade students block-based programming language using [Trinket](https://trinket.io) and [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com). Students were introduced to concepts such as variables and abstractions as they develop, test, and refine their programs. Example projects included creating computer programs to generate sci-fi names for users, designing apps that allow users to free draw, and building super Mario games.</p>  

<p> I implemented a two-week [Data Science curriculum] (https://dayofai.org/curriculum/) developed by MIT. Students engaged in an identity activity called the Daisy Model, where they reflected on critical aspects that defined them and shared with each other. They learned how to categorize, clean, and visualize data by combing information from their Daisy Models into a group dataset in Google Sheets. They also created drawings to represent their identities.
