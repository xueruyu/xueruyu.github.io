<p> I taught a breadth of CS topics (e.g, block-based programming language and Java) and math topics (e.g, algebra, function, and trignometry) in high schools. Example CS projects include creating computer programs to generate sci-fi names for users, designing apps that allow users to free draw, and building super Mario games.</p>
