I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Human-Centered Computing at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing), advised by [Dr. Judith Uchidiuno](https://judithu.com). I design, implement, and evaluate K-12 AI and CS learning experiences. I am interested in exploring how students from diverse backgrounds make sense of technology and construct personally meaningful artifacts. My current work is centered on co-designing a [statewide middle-school AI curriculum](https://ai4ga.org). 

Prior to GT, I received a B.S. in education and math from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) and M.Ed. in learning design from [Harvard University](https://www.gse.harvard.edu). I also worked as a high school CS and math teacher.

In my spare time, I watch sci-fi movies🎬, build lego🏛️, walk in the forests🌲.
