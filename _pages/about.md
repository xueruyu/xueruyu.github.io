I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Learning Science at Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Interactive Computing, advised by Dr. Judith Uchidiuno. I design, implement, and evaluate K-12 AI and CS learning experiences. I am interested in exploring how students from diverse backgrounds make sense of AI and construct computing artifacts. My current work is centered on co-designing a state-wide middle-school AI curriculum. 

Prior to GT, I received a B.S. in education and math from Vanderbilt University and M.Ed. in learning design from Harvard University. I was a high school CS and math teacher in Boston Public School.

In my spare time, I read books📚, watch sports documentary🎾, and listen to classical music🎵.
