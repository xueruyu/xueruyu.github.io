<h2>Redesign Duolingo </h1>

<p> In Spring 2025, I took the Educational Technology course. I led a team of four to redesign Duolingo for undergraduate and graduate students learning Chinese. Through contextual inquiry with users, we identified key limitations that Duolingo often teaches isolated phrases without meaningful context and offers limited opportunities for speaking practice. We developed four new features and iterated through three rounds of prototyping and playtesting. My feature enabled users to learn Chinese phrases directly from movie clips and practice speaking them alongside the characters. Users could get feedback about their tone and pronunciation accuracy.   </p>
